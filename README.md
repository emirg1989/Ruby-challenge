# Ruby challenge 🚀

This is a simple challenge to assess your skills in the Ruby language.

## 1. 🤓 The problem

Given a list of products with their codes and prices (per item and sometime pack):

Product Code | Price

```
--------------------
A            | $2.00 each or 4 for $7.00
B            | $12.00
C            | $1.25 or $6 for a six pack
D            | $0.15
```

Implement - using the Ruby language - a POS or sales terminal that looks something like the following pseudo-code:

```
...
terminal.scan("A")
terminal.scan("C")
... etc.
result = terminal.total
```

And write tests for your POS using the next input as expection:

- Scan these items in this order: **ABCDABAA**; Verify the total price is **$32.40**.
- Scan these items in this order: **CCCCCCC**; Verify the total price is **$7.25**.
- Scan these items in this order: **ABCD**; Verify the total price is **$15.40**.
